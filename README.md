# Desk-Accessories-E-Commerce-Shop
In this project, I've created a desk accessories e-commerce site where customers or users can purchase desk accessories according to their preferences. The project is built using Flask as a web framework and SQLalchemy as an SQL toolkit. The admin can add new products, remove users, and read user queries. On the contrary, Users or customers can add products to the cart, check the cart, remove products from the cart, add queries, and order products with PayPal or cash.
